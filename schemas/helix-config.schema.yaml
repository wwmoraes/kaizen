    description: |-
      Options for navigating and editing using tab key.

      Due to lack of support for S-tab in some terminals, the default
      keybindings don't fully embrace smart-tab editing experience. If you enjoy
      smart-tab navigation and a terminal that supports the Enhanced Keyboard
      protocol, consider setting extra keybindings:

      ```toml
      [keys.normal]
      tab = "move_parent_node_end"
      S-tab = "move_parent_node_start"

      [keys.insert]
      S-tab = "move_parent_node_start"

      [keys.select]
      tab = "extend_parent_node_end"
      S-tab = "extend_parent_node_start"
      ```
    properties: 
      enable:
        default: true
        description: >-
          If set to true, then when the cursor is in a position with
          non-whitespace to its left, instead of inserting a tab, it will run
          move_parent_node_end. If there is only whitespace to the left, then
          it inserts a tab as normal. With the default bindings, to explicitly
          insert a tab character, press Shift-tab.
        type: boolean
      supersede-menu:
        default: false
        description: >-
          Normally, when a menu is on screen, such as when auto complete is
          triggered, the tab key is bound to cycling through the items. This
          means when menus are on screen, one cannot use the tab key to trigger
          the smart-tab command. If this option is set to true, the smart-tab
          command always takes precedence, which means one cannot use the tab
          key to cycle through menu items. One of the other bindings must be
          used instead, such as arrow keys or C-n/C-p.
